pyqt2.py : set of buttons to manually keep track of the played cards  
detect.py: searches in scene.png for templates of cards

TODO  
-restrict the look area to the middle of the window  
-update the detection when new cards are played  
-connect the detection with the deactivation of the buttons/table cells  
-the template matching is confused when the window is resized...
